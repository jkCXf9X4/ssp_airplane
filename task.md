Start to go thru the items in the todo.md list, track your work continuously, create subtasks if necessary. Be critical of the tasks, if alterations are needed to reach the main objective specified in README.md and the todo list, change and tune them as needed.

## Progress log

- Completed the scenario workflow (generator + OMSimulator runner + pytest coverage) and tied it back to the README instructions.
- Added the fuel system across SysML + Modelica plus verification scripts (interfaces, connections, equations).
- Installed the modeling/toolchain dependencies into `third_party/` so scripts can run in a hermetic environment.
