- [ ] Capture the SysML v2 system architecture so it fully defines fuselage, reactor, wings, motors, control software, autopilot, and electrical system.
- [ ] Build the corresponding Modelica models for every subsystem listed in the architecture.
- [ ] Compile each Modelica model into an FMU using the OpenModelica compiler (`omc`).
- [ ] Implement the SSD generation script that parses the architecture and outputs a valid System Structure Definition.
- [ ] Package the generated FMUs together with the SSD into an `.ssp` archive for simulation runs.
- [ ] Set up the optimization loop that tunes wing area, motor size, and carrying capacity using the SSP.
- [ ] Verify the aircraft meets the stated requirements (Boeing 737 size/shape, nuclear propulsion, London→Beijing range).
