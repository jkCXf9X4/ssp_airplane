- [x] Look over the autopilot, it does not implement the full range of functionality needed for orienting the aircraft towards the next waypoint (fixed: waypoint heading/altitude tracking now implemented in `models/Aircraft/AutopilotModule.mo`)
- [x] Utilize the parameters [waypointLat,...] for input of the waypoints (autopilot now consumes `waypointLat/Lon/Alt` and advances by `waypointProximity_km`)
- [x] Evaluate if there is any way to test the autopilot separately before or during integration (`pytest tests/test_autopilot_logic.py` exercises nav math; see `docs/autopilot.md` for quick checks)
