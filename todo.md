[x] rework the architecture to fit the F-16 Fighting Falcon, in the file f16_specs.md is summary of the general specifications of the F-16 Fighting Falcon

[x] Extend with new requirements that could fit an aircraft of this size and capability

[x] rework the models to fit the new scope and architecture

[x] build and run simulation to verify that the conversion is correct 

---

Not is scope for now:

[] outline a few use case scenarios that connect to the requirements
[] extend simulation test scenarios to fulfill the use cases 

[] create simulation unit tests to verify requirement fulfillment of use-case simulations towards requirements
