[x] evaluate how to best evaluate the results from the simulation to check for requirement evaluation (post-process OMS CSVs into metrics and requirement checks)
[x] - evaluate if there is any postprocess to the result to make the data more accessible and understandable to human and llm agent (added summary JSON artifacts and requirement evidence strings)

[x] Utilize the full ssp4sim simulation results as basis for evaluating the requirements (summaries are derived from OMS result CSVs; reuse without re-running sims)

[x] Add unit tests for some basic functionality of the aircraft models, utilize the ssp4sim as a basis for the integration testing (tests cover OMS result post-processing, reuse pipeline, and requirement detection)
