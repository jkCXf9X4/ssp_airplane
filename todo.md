[x] extract the MODEL_CLASS_MAP from the architecture instead of hardcoding it into the scripts (see `scripts/utils/sysml_helpers.py` + `fmi_helpers.py`)
[x] create a fmi utils and lift out common code from the scripts (`scripts/utils/fmi_helpers.py`)
[x] create a sysml utils and lift out common code from the scripts (`scripts/utils/sysml_helpers.py`)
[x] create a ssp utils and lift out common code from the scripts (`scripts/utils/ssp_helpers.py`)
[x] create a map and geometry utils where you lift out commonly used code (`scripts/utils/map_geometry.py`)
