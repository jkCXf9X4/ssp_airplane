[x] Add the option to specify a scenario that the drone should fly
 - the scenario should be consisting of points in space that the drone should visit in order. 
 - The first point should be the starting point, this should be on the ground
 - The last ponit should be the landing point this should also be on the ground
 - Use the data def "GeodeticLLA" as the format for each point in space

[x] the scenarios should be generated by a script 
 - Between 3 nd 10 points should be generated
 - the distance traveled should be between 100km to 1000km
 - The altitude per point should be between 100m and 10000m


[x] create a script for simulating the scenarios using OMSimulator, its available in the venv as a python package

[x] create python unit tests where different scenarios are simulated and evaluate how the requirements are fulfilled 

[x] add a fuel system to the system and ensure that it can run out of fuel in too long scenarios

[x] Verify connections between components 
[x] Verify model equations
