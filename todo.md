[x] review the code under the folder scripts/, 
[x] move build_fmus.py into generators
[x] move package_ssp.py into generators
[x] Establish refactorization possibilities between the script, try to break out commonly used code into separate (created shared literal parser in `scripts/common/sysml_values.py` and adopted across generators)
[x] Utilize these opportunities and refactor the codebase to make it more accessible (cleaned imports, updated documentation/build flow)
